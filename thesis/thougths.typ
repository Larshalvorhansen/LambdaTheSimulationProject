*Thesis title*

Motivation:
- Agent based modeling is closer tied to the real world than common economic equations
- With today's extensive compute power technology, it computationally vuiable to have complex and large ABM's with many complex interactions

Background:
- Step 3 in the method about the external enviroment is something that is allways nessecary to involve in ABM's because any system unless all variables are completly unaffected by an external enviroment, cannot be represented and simulated in its entirity unless the whole universe is simulated.

Method:
+ Define agents from (as of now initially) common sence   
+ Define interacions (as of now initially) common sence
+ Define external enviroment form the OECD database or similar
+ Define initial conditions from the OECD database or similar
+ Simulate many times (monte carlo) with random variables being reset each time
+ Compare with AR(0) and other status quo economic predictors 
+ Reajust agent paremeters, agent interactions and enviroment from result of comparison using reinforcement learning
