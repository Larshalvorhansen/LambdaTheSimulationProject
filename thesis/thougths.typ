*Thesis title*

Motivation:
- Agent based modeling is closer tied to the real world than common economic equations.
- With today's extensive compute power technology, it computationally viable to simulate a large enough amounts of agents with aequatetly complex interactions to derive macroeconomic results from microeconomic theory and experimentation.

Background:

- Defineing some external enviroment is nessecary for a realistic ABM because any system unless all variables are completly unaffected by an external enviroment, cannot be represented and simulated in its entirity unless the whole universe is simulated.

Method:
+ Define agents from common sence(as of now initially)
+ Define interacions from common sence(as of now initially)
+ Define external enviroment form the OECD database or similar
+ Define initial conditions from the OECD database or similar
+ Simulate many times (monte carlo) with random variables being reset each time
+ Compare with AR(0) and other status quo economic predictors 
+ Reajust agent paremeters, agent interactions and enviroment from result of comparison using reinforcement learning
