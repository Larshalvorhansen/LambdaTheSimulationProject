# intrinsicValueEstimator

A tiny subproject trying to estimate the real value of assets, in this case using data from finn.no, in order to accelerate decision-making by automatically narrowing down candidates.

So far, the program **main.py** fetches all the articles from a specified search page URL on Finn, scrapes the HTML, and finally outputs some info from each page—such as address, price, and description—into a single CSV file called **data5.csv**.
